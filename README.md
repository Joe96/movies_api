## Our Project Description

Our project was focused on "The Movie Data Base" API results. The app is for a user to search popular movies to see what they may want to watch. It gives the rating, genre, release date, description and title of the movie. There are six total functions in our javascript. Two that pull data from two API's, an event listener to select type of movie, one that converts genre data so it is readable information, another to save items into local storage and one connected to the second html page to append and display the movie information. The app is designed with CSS, Bootstrap and Uikit to add creative elements. When you first get to the site you are presented with an option to select a genre and also sign up to be apart of the email club. When a genre is selected you are taken to another html which displays the ratings and movie attributes listed above. You can go back to the home page with the back button and select a new genre.
